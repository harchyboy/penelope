# /review — Parallel Code Review

Spawns specialist review agents in parallel. Each agent reviews independently,
then findings are synthesised into a single P1/P2/P3 report.

## Usage

```
/review                    → Smart-filtered review (agents matched to changed files)
/review --full             → Full review (all agents, no filtering)
/review security           → Security-only review
/review typescript         → TypeScript-only review
/review [scope]            → Review specific file or directory
```

## Composable flags

Before processing $ARGUMENTS, parse composable flags per `.claude/docs/composable-flags.md`.
Strip recognized flags (--readonly, --concise, --lean, --seq, --local and their short forms)
from $ARGUMENTS before treating the remainder as this command's input.

Apply active flags throughout:
- --readonly: skip all file writes and write-capable agent spawns
- --concise: limit output to 20 lines max
- --lean: use haiku for subagents, minimize tool calls
- --seq: execute agents sequentially, not in parallel
- --local: route eligible subtasks to Ollama, fall back to haiku if unavailable

## What happens

### Phase 1: Spec compliance (runs FIRST)
1. Read PROGRESS.md and recent git diff to understand what changed
2. Spawn `spec-compliance-reviewer` to verify the implementation matches requirements
3. Wait for spec compliance results before proceeding

### Phase 2: Quality review (parallel)
4. Check docs/solutions/ for related past issues (learnings-researcher step)
5. Determine which quality agents are relevant based on the changes
6. Spawn all relevant quality agents in ONE message (parallel execution)
7. Each agent reviews independently and reports findings

### Phase 3: Synthesis
8. Synthesise all findings (spec + quality) into a single report
9. Present consolidated P1/P2/P3 list with agent attribution

## Agent selection logic — Smart filtering

Before spawning Phase 2 agents, determine which files changed and skip irrelevant agents.

### Step 0: Detect changed files

Run `git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || echo HEAD~1)..HEAD` to get the list of changed files. If that fails, fall back to `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`.

### File category detection

Classify each changed file into one or more categories:

| Category | Glob patterns |
|----------|---------------|
| UI | `**/*.tsx`, `**/*.jsx`, `**/*.vue`, `**/*.svelte`, `**/*.css`, `**/*.scss`, `**/components/**`, `**/pages/**`, `**/layouts/**`, `**/views/**` |
| DB | `**/migrations/**`, `**/db/**`, `**/schema/**`, `**/seeds/**`, `**/models/**`, `**/*.sql`, `**/supabase/**` |
| API | `**/api/**`, `**/routes/**`, `**/controllers/**`, `**/handlers/**`, `**/edge-functions/**` |
| Test | `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`, `**/tests/**`, `**/__tests__/**` |
| TypeScript | `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx` |
| Docs | `**/*.md`, `**/docs/**` |

### Agent-to-category mapping

| Agent | Runs when | Skip when |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `spec-compliance-reviewer` | ALWAYS (Phase 1) | Never skip |
| `security-sentinel` | ANY code file changed | Only docs/config changes |
| `typescript-reviewer` | TypeScript category has matches | No .ts/.tsx files changed |
| `architecture-strategist` | 3+ files changed OR API/DB categories hit | Single-file cosmetic change |
| `error-handling-reviewer` | API or UI category has matches | Only docs/config/test changes |
| `performance-oracle` | DB or API category has matches | No DB or API files changed |
| `data-integrity-guardian` | DB category has matches | No DB files changed |
| `accessibility-reviewer` | UI category has matches | No UI files changed |
| `test-quality-reviewer` | Test category has matches OR new implementation files without corresponding tests | Only docs/config changes |

### Filtering procedure

1. Run git diff to get the changed file list
2. Classify each file into categories using the patterns above
3. For each agent, check if its required categories have matches
4. Log which agents are INCLUDED and which are SKIPPED:

```
Agent filtering (12 files changed):
  ✓ spec-compliance-reviewer — ALWAYS
  ✓ security-sentinel — API files changed (src/api/auth.ts)
  ✓ typescript-reviewer — .ts files changed
  ✗ accessibility-reviewer — SKIPPED (no UI files)
  ✗ data-integrity-guardian — SKIPPED (no DB files)
  ✓ architecture-strategist — 12 files changed (>3 threshold)
  ✓ error-handling-reviewer — API files changed
  ✗ performance-oracle — SKIPPED (no DB/API-heavy files)
  ✓ test-quality-reviewer — test files changed
```

5. Spawn only non-skipped agents (still in ONE message for parallelism, unless --seq)

### Override: --full

If the user passes `--full`, skip all filtering and spawn every agent.
Useful for pre-release reviews or when you want maximum coverage regardless of file categories.

## Parallelism rule

Phase 2 quality agents spawn in ONE message. Never spawn sequentially.

```
# Phase 1 — spec compliance first
spawn spec-compliance-reviewer → wait for results

# Phase 2 — all quality agents in one message
[spawn security-sentinel, spawn typescript-reviewer, spawn architecture-strategist]

# Wrong — sequential spawning wastes time
spawn security-sentinel → wait → spawn typescript-reviewer → wait
```

## Learnings integration

Before finalising the review, run a learnings check:
- Search docs/solutions/ for entries tagged with the same files, components, or error types
- Surface any relevant past issues at the bottom of the report
- Flag if a P2/P3 finding matches a previously documented pattern that escalated

## Consolidated output format

P1 — CRITICAL (must fix before merge)
──────────────────────────────────────
[ ] [Issue] (security-sentinel) — auth/login.ts:42
    Risk: Attacker can bypass auth by manipulating token
    Fix: Validate JWT server-side in middleware, not client

[ ] [Issue] (data-integrity-guardian) — migrations/003.sql:15
    Risk: Migration drops NOT NULL constraint, data loss possible
    Fix: Add DEFAULT value before removing NOT NULL

P2 — IMPORTANT (should fix, can be follow-up task)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
[ ] [Issue] (typescript-reviewer) — components/PipelineView.tsx:88
[ ] [Issue] (performance-oracle) — hooks/useListings.ts:34

## After review

- P1 items: create tasks immediately, block merge
- P2 items: create follow-up tasks, can merge with plan
- P3 items: log in PROGRESS.md for next session
- Run `/compound` after fixing P1/P2 items to capture learnings
